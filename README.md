## Status

Phase 0 (project foundation) and Phase 1 (core read-only browsing: SAF folder access, Room-backed
file index, source-app detection, navigation shell) are done — CI is green end-to-end, including a
successful `assembleDebug`. Phase 2 (Settings screen) is next. See `docs/PLAN.md` for the full
phase list.

## Building

This project is built and tested via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/android-ci.yml`). To build
locally you'll need the Android SDK (compileSdk 35) and JDK 17:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```
